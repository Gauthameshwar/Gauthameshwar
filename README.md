Radhe Shyam! My name is Gauthameshwar. I'm a theoretical physicist who gets paid to write codes, run simulations, and explore the fascinating physics that happens in the  
( っ˶°૦°˶)づ ✧⋆｡°✩ Quantum Realm  ✧˖°.⁺‧˚ ♡ ˚‧⁺ ✧˖°.

As a budding researcher who mainly depends on numerical analysis more than writing equations with chalk on a board, the computer is my best friend. Hence, I am excited to learn programming languages that offer speed and performance (yes, I'm talking about Julia), or have an active open-source community that develops libraries to study quantum systems (that's Python). Excited to dive into the world of GitHub and contribute to the scientific community!
